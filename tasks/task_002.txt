### Details:
Ensure the form supports validation, error handling, and accessibility best practices.
<info added on 2025-05-31T19:25:14.709Z>
Implemented a comprehensive event form structure with robust validation and user experience features.

Branding support has been successfully implemented across the event management system:

**Branding Features Implemented:**
- **Color Customization**: Primary and secondary color selection with visual color picker and hex input validation

**Technical Implementation:**
- Branding data stored in EventBranding interface with primaryColor, secondaryColor, fontFamily, and logo fields
- CSS custom properties used for dynamic color application
- Inline styles for gradient backgrounds and color theming
- Validation ensures hex color format compliance
- Responsive design maintains branding consistency across devices

**User Experience:**
- Intuitive color picker with both visual and text input options
- Immediate visual feedback through color preview swatches

The responsive design adapts across all device sizes.

Visual design elements include dynamic gradient backgrounds as fallbacks, typography hierarchy with bold event titles, organized information layout with icons, interactive elements with hover effects, and proper accessibility contrast. Technical implementation features dynamic styling with CSS custom properties, conditional rendering based on event data, Lucide React icons for information display, responsive flexbox layout, and optimized performance for image loading.

The user experience delivers visual impact with an engaging hero section, clear information hierarchy, prominent action buttons, consistent branding, and mobile optimization with touch-friendly elements and readable text across all screen sizes.

## 4. Build Media Gallery Component [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Develop a gallery to showcase event images and videos, supporting uploads and responsive display.
### Details:
Allow organizers to add, remove, and reorder media assets. Optimize for performance and accessibility.
<info added on 2025-05-31T19:32:52.406Z>
**Current Analysis & Implementation Plan:**

**Current State:**
- EventDisplay component has basic media gallery that displays images/videos in a 3-column grid
- EventMedia interface defined with id, type, url, alt, caption fields
- No media upload functionality in EventForm yet
- Media array is part of Event interface but not EventFormData

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create dedicated MediaGallery component with enhanced features:
   - Lightbox/modal view for full-size images
   - Video player controls
   - Responsive grid layout
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Accessibility features

2. Create MediaUpload component for EventForm:
   - File upload with drag & drop
   - Image/video preview
   - Caption editing
   - Reordering capabilities
   - File validation and size limits
   - Progress indicators

3. Update EventFormData and validation schema to include media
4. Integrate MediaUpload into EventForm
5. Enhance EventDisplay to use new MediaGallery component

**Technical Approach:**
- Use HTML5 file input with drag & drop
- Client-side file validation
- Base64 encoding for demo (localStorage)
- Responsive design with CSS Grid
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels for accessibility
