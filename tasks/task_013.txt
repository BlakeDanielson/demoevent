# Task ID: 13
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Testing Suite for Registration and Ticketing System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a robust testing suite covering unit, integration, and end-to-end browser tests for the registration and ticketing system, ensuring all user flows and integrations are thoroughly validated.
# Details:
Design and implement a multi-layered testing strategy for the registration and ticketing system. 

- Unit Tests: Write tests for all core components and utilities, including form field validation, file upload logic, ticket selection, and group registration logic. Use Jest and React Testing Library for React components, and mock Firebase interactions where appropriate.
- Integration Tests: Test the interaction between the registration form, ticketing logic, and backend data storage (PostgreSQL or Firebase). Validate that data flows correctly from the UI to the backend and that group registrations and file uploads are processed as expected. Use tools like Supertest (for API endpoints) and MSW (Mock Service Worker) for mocking network requests.
- End-to-End (E2E) Browser Tests: Use a browser automation tool such as Playwright or Cypress to simulate real user interactions. Cover the entire user journey: navigating from the event page, completing the multi-step registration form (including file uploads and group registration), selecting tickets, validating form errors, and confirming registration. Ensure tests run in CI/CD and capture screenshots or videos on failure.
- Special Considerations: Test edge cases such as invalid file types, exceeding ticket limits, concurrent group registrations, and network failures. Ensure accessibility and responsiveness are validated in E2E tests. Integrate test coverage reporting and enforce minimum thresholds in CI/CD.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run all unit and integration tests locally and in CI/CD, ensuring 100% pass rate and high coverage (e.g., >90%).
2. Execute E2E browser tests in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit) and screen sizes to verify the complete user flow from event page to registration confirmation, including file uploads and group registration.
3. Validate that form validation errors are displayed correctly, tickets are reserved and confirmed, and registration data is stored in the backend.
4. Simulate failure scenarios (e.g., network errors, invalid input) and verify graceful error handling.
5. Review test coverage reports and CI/CD logs to confirm all critical paths and edge cases are tested.
