# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Project Repository and CI/CD Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the project repository with recommended tech stack, linting, and CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
# Details:
Initialize a Next.js (v14) project with TypeScript (v5), Tailwind CSS (v3), and React Hook Form (v7). Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD, including automated testing and deployment to Vercel. Use Firebase for authentication and storage as specified in the PRD. Add Sentry for error monitoring and New Relic for performance tracking.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository setup, linting, and CI/CD pipeline by running automated tests and deploying a basic landing page. Ensure all integrations (Firebase, Sentry, New Relic) are functional.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Repository and Next.js Project [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Git repository and initialize a Next.js project with TypeScript, ESLint, and the App Router.

## 3. Set Up Linting and Formatting Tools [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting consistency.
### Details:
Ensure ESLint is set up (from Next.js init), install Prettier, and configure both tools to work together. Add lint and format scripts to package.json.

## 4. Configure CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Set up GitHub Actions workflows for linting, testing, and deployment.
### Details:
Create workflow YAML files to automate linting, testing, and deployment to Vercel or another platform. Ensure the pipeline runs on pull requests and pushes to main.

## 5. Integrate Firebase Services [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add Firebase to the project for authentication, database, or hosting as needed.
### Details:
Install Firebase SDK, initialize Firebase in the project, and configure environment variables for Firebase credentials.

## 6. Set Up Sentry and New Relic Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Integrate Sentry for error tracking and New Relic for performance monitoring.
### Details:
Install and configure Sentry and New Relic SDKs, set up environment variables, and verify monitoring is active in both dashboards.

## 7. Verify Deployment and Integrations [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4, 1.5, 1.6
### Description: Deploy the application and confirm all integrations (Firebase, Sentry, New Relic) and CI/CD are functioning correctly.
### Details:
Trigger a deployment via the CI/CD pipeline, verify the app is live, and check that Firebase, Sentry, and New Relic are reporting as expected.
