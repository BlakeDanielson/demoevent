# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Security and Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop secure authentication, role-based access, and data protection.
# Details:
Implement JWT-based authentication with Firebase Auth. Add role-based access control (RBAC) for organizers, attendees, and admins. Encrypt sensitive data (AES-256), enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.3), and implement input validation, SQL injection prevention, and XSS protection. Use rate limiting (100 requests/min/IP).

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication, role-based access, data encryption, and security headers. Verify rate limiting and input validation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Authentication Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a secure authentication mechanism to verify user identities before granting access to the system.
### Details:
Choose an authentication method (e.g., OAuth2, JWT, SAML), integrate with identity providers if needed, and ensure secure password storage and handling.

## 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Design and enforce RBAC policies to manage user permissions based on roles.
### Details:
Define roles and permissions, create a clear hierarchy, apply the principle of least privilege, and use policy-as-code or external authorization systems for scalability and maintainability.

## 3. Data Encryption [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Ensure sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
### Details:
Implement encryption for databases, file storage, and backups. Use strong encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256) and manage encryption keys securely.

## 4. HTTPS Enforcement [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Enforce HTTPS across all endpoints to secure data transmission.
### Details:
Obtain and configure SSL/TLS certificates, redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, and regularly update certificates.

## 5. Input Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement robust input validation to prevent malicious data from entering the system.
### Details:
Validate and sanitize all user inputs on both client and server sides, enforce strict data types, and use allow-lists where possible.

## 6. SQL Injection and XSS Prevention [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Protect the application from SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
### Details:
Use parameterized queries, ORM frameworks, and output encoding. Regularly review code for vulnerabilities and apply security patches.

## 7. Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and mitigate denial-of-service attacks.
### Details:
Set thresholds for API requests, apply per-user or per-IP limits, and provide meaningful error responses when limits are exceeded.

## 8. Security Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7
### Description: Conduct comprehensive security testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
### Details:
Perform automated and manual testing, including penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and code reviews. Document findings and implement fixes.
